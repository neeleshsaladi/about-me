Neelesh Saladi - Section 1 - Dr. Case 11 am

Hi everyone! , I am Neelesh Saladi (Neel), I am in my first semester of Masters in Applied Computer Science (ACS) at Northwest Missouri State University. I am very excited to start my studies at NWMSU as everyone is very good and interactive that I am not even feeling as I'm far from my home and home country. 

I am from Hyderabad, Telangana, India. I had done my bachelors in Information Technology as my major from SRM University, Chennai in the class of 2019. I like to travel a lot and explore every place, I want to start a blog in where I’ll add all the information about the places I traveled, I click a lot of pictures and my blog will have travel photography. In my free time I like to cook and watch N number of movies, TV shows, I also go for a Hike or a Trek once in a while.

My Current goal is to achieve a role as a full-stack developer in MNC. Starting from this I’m planning my future ahead to achieve my goals which I am aspiring from my childhood.

I am thriving to learn much more from this master's program and improve my coding skills, Hope I can have a great time with you all.
